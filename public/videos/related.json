This instantly lets us know that things will be changed up from the original game as though the setting is the same, the circumstances aren't.\n\nThe entire first game took place roughly over the space of a year with us getting several seasons all denoting certain themes and time periods.¬†\n\nDuring this point in the original release, Joel was actually recovering from falling on some Rebarb and Ellie was out hunting for medicine and food whilst he was resting up.\n\nHere she came across David who seemed like a good Samaritan that was just trying to help her out. He was however revealed to be the leader of a group of cannibals and he was also probably a nonce.\n\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/",

The film was a box office phenomenon that's pretty much remained as the highest grossing film of all time for the 13 years since it's release. Avengers Endgame managed to snatch the crown back from it only for the inevitable to happen and it once more regained it's spot at the top.\n\nHowever, there hasn't really been that much hype for it and I have to admit that I wasn't that interested. I think I'd probably only seen the movie at the cinema when it released and then maybe watched it once more at home. I always remembered it being kinda mid with a heavy reliance on the 3D that kinda lost it's appeal once you removed that. However I actually went back at the weekend and rewatched the film and I have to say that I was wrong and it definitely stands on it's own two feet even without the technology behind it. The movie really captivated me and I think it stands on it's own two feet without needing to strap massive glasses onto your head sometimes over your glasses.\n\nNow I'm guessing a lot of you are in the same boat as me where you haven't watched the movie since it released so if you need a quick catch up then the next part of the video is for you. I've left timecodes below if you just wanna skip to the trailer stuff but we start off in the far distant future of 2154. The world is almost a barren wasteland due to humanity using up all of Earth's natural resources and it now looks like a night out in Glasgow.\n\nEarly on we meet Jake Sully, an ex marine who was left paralysed after a combat mission he was on went awry. Jakes brother was part of the Avatar programme which allowed someone to control a host body through their consciouness so that humans could interact with the locals on any planet they landed on by looking like them. However Jakes brother died and due to the Avatars taking genetic material from the person piloting them they needed a match which came in the form of Jake, his twin brothers twin...brother.\n\nKeep up yeah.\n\nAnyway along with the Resources Development Administration or RDA for short they headed out to the Planet Pandora. Attempting to obtain a special element called Unobtanium...which...yeah I forgot it was called that.",
